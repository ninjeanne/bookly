  / comparison of estimation vs. real time spent.  BLUE  📘

### 2. Technical ability 

- Demo - PP Alex   📙

- Extend of functionality – PP reasoning Alex  📙
  ( points off if you have too few or 
  trivial use cases that don’t count like 
  log-in, log-out, register )

- Class diagram – Nico  📙

### 3. Quality

- Architecture –    📙

- Configuration –   📙

- Automation –  will be completed next semester  Alex   📗
	for example, the last push of the day can
 trigger all kinds of things, metrics, tests,
 deployment (next semester we will do this) 
 currently IDE, git and PM should be integrated already.
