### 1. Understand business need 

- Vision           done
- Use case         done
- Srs              done
- non-functionals  tbd
- scope			   done

- Project Methodology: SCRUM     done

- Project Management: YouTrack   done

- RUP and long-term planning: done

- Iterative Process, sprint every 2 week 
	One week is to short because of time spent at university
	and personal appointments.

- Cost Estimation (FP -> time (time is money)) 
  / comparison of estimation vs. real time spent.  BLUE  📘

### 2. Technical ability 

- Demo - PP Alex

- Extend of functionality – PP reasoning Alex
  ( points off if you have too few or 
  trivial use cases that don’t count like 
  log-in, log-out, register )

- Class diagram – Nico

### 3. Quality

- Architecture – 

- Configuration – 

- Automation –  will be completed next semester  Alex
	for example, the last push of the day can
 trigger all kinds of things, metrics, tests,
 deployment (next semester we will do this) 
 currently IDE, git and PM should be integrated already.

- Continuous Integration / -Life cycle management 
(automatic deploy etc.)   Alex

- Risk Mgmt.- (excel sheet that shows that you have a list
 of risks that you kept up to date on a weekly basis,
 how you mitigated risks - dont show an xcel sheet 
 during a presentation!)   BLUE  📘

- Testing CUCUMBER SS

- Patterns   BLUE  📘

- Metrics    BLUE  📘

### 4. Additional Requirements

- testcoverage BLUE  📘
 
- Test Plan includes 3 different tests  BLUE  📘
+ include lifecycle management tools and metrics + change BLUE  📘

- Functional Test
 
+ unit test    BLUE  📘
+ one other test (like installation, stress test, …) BLUE  📘


Project Management

future long-term plan using FP estimation BLUE  📘

(including hours/team member breakdown)
 
- FP calculation BLUE   📘
 (include esimtes and actual time spent comparison)
 
Quality:

- SAD document

+ includes pattern highlighted as part of architecture BLUE  📘

- Testing
	- unit BLUE  📘
- Pattern          (place in SAD) explain pattern BLUE   📘
