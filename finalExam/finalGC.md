- Iterative Process, sprint every 2 week     ğŸ“—

	and personal appointments.

- Cost Estimation (FP -> time (time is money)) 
  / comparison of estimation vs. real time spent.  ğŸ“—

### 2. Technical ability 

- Demo - PP UPDATE   ğŸ“™

- Extend of functionality ğŸ“—
  ( points off if you have too few or 
  trivial use cases that donâ€™t count like 
  log-in, log-out, register )

- Class diagram â€“ UPDATE  ğŸ“™

### 3. Quality

- Architecture â€“ UPDATE SAD   ğŸ“™

- Configuration â€“   ğŸ“™

- Automation â€“  will be completed next semester    ğŸ“—
	for example, the last push of the day can
 trigger all kinds of things, metrics, tests,
 deployment (next semester we will do this) 
 currently IDE, git and PM should be integrated already.

- Continuous Integration / -Life cycle management 
(automatic deploy etc.)                         ğŸ“—

- Risk Mgmt.- (excel sheet that shows that you have a list
 of risks that you kept up to date on a weekly basis,
 how you mitigated risks - dont show an xcel sheet 
 during a presentation!)   ğŸ“—

- Testing CUCUMBER ğŸ“—

- Testing
	- unit ğŸ“—
	- functional ğŸ“—

- Patterns   ğŸ“—

- Metrics    UPDATE ğŸ“™

- SAD document UPDATE ğŸ“™

+ includes pattern highlighted as part of architecture ğŸ“—

- Pattern          (place in SAD) explain pattern UPDATE ğŸ“™

### 4. Additional Requirements

- testcoverage ğŸ“—
 
- Test Plan includes 3 different tests  UPDATE ğŸ“™
+ include lifecycle management tools and metrics + change UPDATE ğŸ“™

+ unit test    ğŸ“—
+ one other test (like installation, stress test, â€¦) DO FIELD TEST ğŸ“™


Project Management

- future long-term plan using FP estimation ğŸ“—
  (including hours/team member breakdown) UPDATE ğŸ“™
 
- FP calculation ğŸ“—
 (include esimtes and actual time spent comparison) UPDATE ğŸ“™
 
### 5. Reminder
Be prepared: At the end of the semester I will be asking you to compare time-estimate with time-actual for the new use cases.
